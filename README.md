## Overview
Week 2 of the Introduction to Ruby and Web Development.
OOP version of the BlackJack Game. 

###BlackJack.rb
Similar to Chris's solution, however I tried to minimize the number of lines of code, for instance
using "2.times do" instead of duplicating the "player.add_card(deck.deal_one) and the dealer variant" twice

###BlackJackv2.rb
The Dealer class now inherits from the player class

Looking forward to Week 3
